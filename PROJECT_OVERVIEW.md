## 🚀 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core PDF Tools (Months 1-3)
**Goal**: Prove value with essential PDF operations
- ✅ Basic PDF operations (split, merge, convert, compress, protect)
- ✅ Simple upload → process → download workflows
- ✅ User authentication and file management
- ✅ Freemium pricing model

### Phase 2: Workflow Automation (Months 4-6)
**Goal**: Create competitive differentiation
- 🔄 Visual workflow builder (3-5 step chains)
- 🔄 Email integration for processing attachments
- 🔄 Workflow templates and sharing
- 🔄 Usage analytics and limits

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Teams (Months 7-12)
**Goal**: Justify premium pricing and retention
- ⏳ OCR and basic AI features
- ⏳ Team workspaces and collaboration
- ⏳ External integrations (Google Drive, Zapier)
- ⏳ Advanced analytics and enterprise features

## 🎯 Target Users & Pricing

### Primary: Small Business Professionals
- **Profile**: Freelancers, consultants, small agencies
- **Volume**: 10-100 PDFs monthly
- **Budget**: $10-50/month
- **Pricing**: Professional tier at $15/month

### Secondary: Small Teams (5-20 people)
- **Profile**: Marketing agencies, law firms, real estate offices
- **Volume**: 100-1000 PDFs monthly
- **Budget**: $50-200/month
- **Pricing**: Team tier at $49/month

## 🔧 Development Methodology

### AI-Assisted Development
- **Context Engineering**: Comprehensive context documents for AI interactions
- **Quality Standards**: TypeScript strict mode, 80%+ test coverage, comprehensive error handling
- **Iterative Development**: Start small, add context, validate incrementally

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-commit**: Linting, type checking, formatting
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, security audits, deployment
- **Code Review**: AI-generated code review with human oversight
- **File Size Monitoring**: Automated alerts for files exceeding size limits
- **Refactoring Triggers**: Continuous monitoring with automated suggestions

## 📊 Success Metrics

### 6-Month Goals
- **1,000 registered users** with 8% paid conversion
- **$8,000 MRR** with positive unit economics
- **Core workflow features** with high user satisfaction

### 12-Month Goals
- **10,000 users** with improved conversion rates
- **$50,000 MRR** with clear path to profitability
- **Team features** driving higher-value customers

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start**: Pull changes, update AI context, plan tasks
2. **Develop**: Use context assembly for AI interactions, update docs
3. **Quality**: Run checks frequently, commit with clear messages
4. **End**: Update context, document learnings, push changes

### AI Programming Rules
1. **TypeScript First**: All code must be TypeScript with strict mode
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Schema-First**: Define database/API schemas before coding
4. **Security-First**: Validate all inputs, sanitize all outputs
5. **Performance-First**: Consider performance implications upfront
6. **Size-Conscious**: Monitor file sizes and refactor proactively

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **File Handling**: Secure upload, processing, and deletion
- **User Privacy**: GDPR compliance, data minimization

### Infrastructure Security
